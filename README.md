Learning Assistant will provide a platform for user to choose a learning goal they want to accomplish by a certain amount of time. User will post the learning specific goal and timeline for achieving that. She can divide that into specific task and have timelines for those one too. Our app will provide reminder along with other features that we are still brainstorming to help proliferate the process of actually getting the learning goal accomplished.

We are using cloudmine for back end data retrieval tool. All our team members are front end developers, so cloundmine will come in handy. And we are also using webstorm IDE along with ionic framework to have interactive user interface and other front end features. Javascript, CSS and HTML5 are the languages we are staying with to make the website version which then ionic will help transfer to a mobile app. Mainly, it will be a mobile application.
